# update-usa-flag

Just before the 4th of July this year, I thought up a fun toy project to test my JavaScript/programming learning so far:  use JS to figure out the best-fit layout of stars on the blue portion of the US flag (the "union", I found out that part is called), once we added more states.

Now I'm expanding my knowledge of git and GitHub, and going back to this project idea, simultaneously. :us:
