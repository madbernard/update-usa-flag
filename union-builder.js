//us flag star mapper -- for a given number of stars, how do they condense into a square
//height of "union" is 7/13, width of union is 0.76

//make set of arrays where two numbers, height and width, are
//reduce arrays to find array with minimum deviation (%) from 7/13 / 0.76
//return that array

//array sets can be:  even and odd rows where odd can be 1 more than even
//or where both even and odd are equal
//or where this test is done with half the total and then doubled (symmetry across horizontal center)
//or where first line or lines follow different pattern from middle lines
